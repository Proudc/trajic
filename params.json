{"tagline":"A GPS trajectory compression system","body":"### Synopsis\r\nTrajic is a program for compressing GPS trajectory data. To find out more about how the system works and see some experimental results, check out the [official research paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzire8nwfte01ot/trajic.pdf). Doxygen documentation is also [available](doc/index.html).\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to format input data is as a CSV file. Each line should be formatted as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<timestamp in milliseconds>, <latitude>, <longitude>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nCompress a trajectory losslessly:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrajic c traj.plt\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompress a trajectory with max errors of 0.1 s temporally and 0.001 degrees\r\nspatially:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrajic c traj.csv 0.1 0.001\r\n```\r\n\r\nDecompress a trajectory:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrajic d traj.tjc\r\n```","note":"Don't delete this file!
